# Cubic Equation Analyzer – COSC-220 Final Project

This Java application is designed to analyze cubic equations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It takes a cubic polynomial as input and performs a comprehensive mathematical analysis.
---

## 🔍 Features

- Parses cubic equations from input
- Identifies **x- and y-intercepts**
- Determines the **point of inflection**
- Analyzes **relative minimum and maximum points**
  
---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `main.java` – Entry point of the program
- `input.txt` – Contains sample cubic equations for analysis
- `PolynomialClass.java`, `MonomialClass.java`, `BinomialClass.java` – Core classes representing polynomial elements
- `CoordinateClass.java` – Handles coordinate point representation
- `DisplayGraph.java` – Visualizes the cubic equation on a graph

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. The user provides a cubic equation via `input.txt`.
2. The program parses the input and constructs the polynomial using custom Java classes.
3. Mathematical analysis is performed:
   - First and second derivatives are used to find turning points and inflection points.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Java (OOP principles)
- Custom data structures and math utilities
- Java Swing (for graph display if applicable)

## 📌 Usage

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ulugbek999/Cubic_Equation_Analyzer-COSC-220_finalPRJ.git
Compile and run:


javac *.java
java main
Modify the input.txt file to test different equations.

📘 Example Input

f(x) = 2x^3 - 4x^2 + x - 5
